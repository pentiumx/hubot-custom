# Description:
#   Example scripts for you to examine and try out.
#
# Notes:
#   They are commented out by default, because most of them are pretty silly and
#   wouldn't be useful and amusing enough for day to day huboting.
#   Uncomment the ones you want to try and experiment with.
#
#   These are from the scripting documentation: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

module.exports = (robot) ->

  # robot.hear /badger/i, (res) ->
  #   res.send "Badgers? BADGERS? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN BADGERS"

  # Super simple example: If the robot detects the word "thank you",
  # it just responds it with "you're welcome".
  robot.hear /(.*)thank you(.*)/i, (res) ->
    robot.messageRoom room, "you're welcome."
